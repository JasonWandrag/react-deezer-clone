# Jason Wandrag DVT Assignment

I created this app using React/Node/Express

## How to run this app?

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm serve` in the root folder (it will host the frontend app on port 3000)
3. Run `nodemon index.js` in the backend folder (it will host the backend on port 8001)
4. Enjoy!
