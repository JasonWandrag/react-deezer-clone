# Jason Wandrag DVT Assignment

I created this app using React/Node/Express

## How to run this app?

1. Run `git clone` in desired folder, then `cd` into the project folder
2. Run `npm install` in the root folder
3. Run `npm run start` in the root folder (it will host the frontend app on port 3000)
4. Run `npm install` in the backend folder
5. Run `nodemon index.js` in the backend folder (it will host the backend on port 8001)
6. Enjoy!
